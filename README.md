Welcome to StarBot, a bot for Discord.

StarBot is my current WIP Project that is based off of the NadekoBot's Framework that is open source.

Even though StarBot is based off of Nadeko's frame, I will be making my own custom commands, functions and activities to do with the bot, and only a small bit of nadeko's frame will be left.

## Open Source

Currently, StarBot is not in Open Source but should be in about a month or so [ Subject to Change ]. Along with it not being open source currently, that also means that it will be a private bot until development has finished.

If you would like to help or contribute to the development of StarBot, please contact me on the official StarBot Discord

Yes, invites to other servers for the bot has been disabled c:

## What to Expect

StarBot may be using the NadekoBot's Frame/Initial Coding, but I assure you that StarBot will have it's own custom commands and functions as well as activities that the users of the bot can take part in, such as trivia, tic-tac-toe [ If I can ever make it work :'c ] and hangman. Those are only just a few - and with the help of the community, the bot can become something much bigger.

## Ending

I appreciate you all taking the time to read this far into the ReadMe. As mentioned earlier, developer spots for the bot itself are open and with the help of you guys, this bot CAN and WILL become much, much bigger.
